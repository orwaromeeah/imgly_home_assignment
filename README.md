Summary of Commits:

Commit 1:
In the initial commit, I attempted to sort the images by analyzing the greenness of the first pixel. However, this method didn't yield accurate sorting results because some images had different first pixels than the rest of the background.

Commit 3:
In the third commit, I refined the sorting method by comparing the last pixel in each image. This approach successfully sorted the images based on their background colors, with images having greener backgrounds positioned higher in the grid.

Challenges Faced:
The primary challenge I encountered was setting up the iOS environment, as my recent experience has been primarily with Flutter rather than native iOS development over the past three years. Despite this hurdle, I managed to overcome the challenge and successfully implement the required functionality. Additionally, due to restrictions on creating private repositories when I initially created my GitHub account, I pushed the repository as public instead of private.
